# Artificial Intelligence Project with MATLAB
- In order to run this program you need to have the deep learning toolbox downloaded.
- On top of that, you will need to have downloaded the CIFAR10 dataset from the link below. Luckily! All you have to do is run the model.m file and the cifar-10 batches will be downloaded automatically for you!
